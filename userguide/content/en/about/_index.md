The aim of the project is to analyze how COVID-19’s Lockdown of March-May 2020 changed and reshaped little shops, micro-companies and services. The nerve of the neighborhood. The research, declined on different product category, would later be the cornerstone and base to design some solutions (step 2) that later could be some action to develop / deliver late in September.

## What's this project about?

The name of the project (ctrl-z) is picturing a step of our human fight against the virus that assumes we would be back to normal, or - as many define it - the new-normal.

With ctrl-z we are looking (in within a humble student project) to define good practices that could play as social and technological antibodies to the commercial disease we are and will be witnessing in all the little commerce (as opposed to big food / commercial distributors that were not affected - if blessed, in a dark way - from the lockdown)

The project is addressing students from [Cloud Services, Big data e IoT](https://www.its-ictpiemonte.it/courses/cloud-services-big-data-iot/) course of [ITS-ICT](https://www.its-ictpiemonte.it/) of Torino, and is structured in 3 different steps:

*   **identification and analysis**
*   **Design and Development of a solution**
*   **prototyping and deliver to the "client" (optional based on the clients themselves)**

  <tr>
   <td><strong>Identification and Analysis</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Groups are created based on the knowledge of the class (Buzzi/Fasano)

Each group starts from the case studies. Hopefully the list will be integrated and enlarged.
Group and case study are paired, and a field research starts (phone calls, online forms).
A slack / discord Channel is devoted to each group / case study.
Weekly updates are made with the teachers.

Our mission is to identify the problem, rather than finding a possible solution to it. Each problem will be pitched in a slide with sources and datasets used. Picture.

→ [Mozilla Connected Home Design Sprint](https://github.com/openiotstudio/general/blob/master/publications/research/20160417_Mozilla_Connected%20Homes_Design%20Sprint%20Scenarios_V1.pdf/) is a good example of a case study analysis made by [Quicksand](http://quicksand.co.in/).

Each theme presents and push the information on our repository > site

   <td><strong>Design and Prototyping of a Solution</strong>
   </td>
   <td>

   The teams are asked to confront and develop several solutions (using Miro? G Slides?). It’s important to be realistic and confront / look on what is there on the market, as well as understanding the legal aspects of several solution affecting privacy, economics etc..

This step is not about creating a physical prototype, rajer sketch it on paper. We should also take down a list of stakeholder, and costs to produce and deliver.

Again. The ending deliverable of this step is a slide / resources dataset to be pitched.

   <td><strong>Development and Deployment</strong>
   </td>
   <td>Teams, teachers and the school decide which projects are actually doable, on a financial point of view.

For the projects that are going to access to this step, the group will be asked to produce, together with the team (and possibly asking advice to external developers) a Bill of Materials and a Technology feasibility analysis

The final prototype has to meet in between 5 and 6 level of the [Nasa TRL scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level) and will be temporarily installed to the client.


Some extra copies of the final prototypes are going to be produced for showcasing the educational experience outside of the school, in Educational and Work faires in order to promote the course.
